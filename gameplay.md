# Basic gameplay

## Harming enemies

Enemy extraterrestrials roam the planet HD 011235 b. Some walk on the ground, while some float in the air. To destroy all enemies, you can either `Jump` on its head or `Shoot a projectile` at it. `Shooting a projectile` at an enemy *will not* award you with a point.

## Gaining lives

You can gain additional lives by opening `Chests` placed around the world, or by accumulating 10 `Coins`.

## The final level

After the first 5 levels, you must fight a boss to get home. The boss must be hit _at least_ 10 times to be defeated. After each hit, you are bounced back. After the 10 hits, the end goal appears, and if you hit the boss once more, the boss is defeated.

_Welcome back home._
