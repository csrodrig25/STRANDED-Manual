# Basic gameplay

## Harming enemies

Enemy aliens roam the planet B-01123. Some walk on the ground, while ssome float in the air. To destroy all enemies, you can either ` Jump ` on its head or ` Shoot a projectile ` at it. ` Shooting a projectile ` at an enemy *will not* award you with a point.

## Gaining lives

You can gain additional lives by opening ` Chests ` placed around the world, or by accumulating 10 ` Coins `.
